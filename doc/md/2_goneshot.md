### Windows GUI
Windows users might be interested in checkout [Goneshot](https://github.com/raphaelreyna/goneshot)(beta).
If for some reason, you would rather *not* use a command line, [Goneshot](https://github.com/raphaelreyna/goneshot)(beta) wraps oneshot with a GUI (graphical user interface) which might be easier to use. A macOS version will probably be made at some point.
