## oneshot

A single-fire HTTP server.

### Synopsis

Start an HTTP server which will only serve files once.
The first client to connect is given the file, all others receive an HTTP 410 Gone response code.

If no file is given, oneshot will instead serve from stdin and hold the clients connection until receiving the EOF character.
